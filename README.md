# ðŸ§  Personal C Projects

Welcome to my collection of personal C language projects â€” built for learning, exploration, and sharpening low-level programming skills. Each project is focused on systems-level thinking, algorithms, or just plain fun.

## ðŸš€ About This Repo

This repository contains various C programs I've written as part of my personal learning journey. These range from simple utilities to explorations into data structures, memory management, and Linux internals.

Each project has its own folder with:

- Source code (`.c` and `.h` files)
- A `README.md` explaining what it does
- Build instructions (usually using `Makefile`)
- Sample input/output (if relevant)

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview

| `TikTacToe`  | A simple terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in the C programming language |

_This list will grow as I continue building and experimenting._

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

Most projects use `make` for building.

```bash
cd project-folder
make
./program-name
```
